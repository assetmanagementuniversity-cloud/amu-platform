# Case Study: Mzansi Mining Corporation

## Background

Mzansi Mining Corporation (MMC) is a mid-sized South African mining company operating three sites in Limpopo Province. The company has been in operation for 25 years and employs approximately 2,500 people.

MMC has recently experienced several challenges:
- Unexpected equipment failures leading to production losses
- Increasing maintenance costs (up 15% year-on-year)
- Difficulty attracting skilled maintenance personnel
- Regulatory pressure around safety and environmental compliance
- New CEO with a mandate to improve operational efficiency

## Current Situation

The new CEO, Ms. Nomvula Dlamini, has identified asset management as a key area for improvement. She has appointed you as the Asset Management Coordinator to help develop a strategic approach.

Currently, MMC operates in a reactive mode. Equipment is repaired when it breaks down, and there is no formal asset management policy or strategy in place.
