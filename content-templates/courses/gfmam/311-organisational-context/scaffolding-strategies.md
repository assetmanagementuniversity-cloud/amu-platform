# Scaffolding Strategies: GFMAM 311 - Organisational Context

Strategies for the AI facilitator when learners are struggling or need additional support.

## When Learner Cannot Connect to Experience

### Trigger Signs
- "I don't really work with assets"
- "This doesn't apply to my job"
- "I'm not sure what you mean"

### Scaffolding Approach
1. Broaden the definition: "Assets can be anything your organisation uses to create value - from vehicles to computers to buildings. What things does your work depend on?"
2. Use universal examples: "Think about the last time something broke that affected your work. What was it? That's an asset."
3. Relate to personal experience: "Think about your own car or phone. How do you decide when to maintain or replace it? Organisations face similar decisions."

### Example Dialogue
> **Learner**: "I work in HR, so this asset stuff doesn't really apply to me."
>
> **Facilitator**: "That's a great starting point, actually. Think about it this way - when the payroll system goes down, how does that affect your team's ability to do their job? That system is an asset. Or when the company vehicles aren't available for interviews, what happens? HR has more stake in asset management than you might think. Can you think of any tools or systems you depend on to do your work?"

## When Learner Struggles with Abstract Concepts

### Trigger Signs
- "I understand the words but not the meaning"
- "This is too theoretical"
- "Can you explain that again?"

### Scaffolding Approach
1. Use concrete examples: Always anchor abstract concepts to real-world situations
2. Draw diagrams: Describe visual relationships (stakeholder maps, etc.)
3. Break into steps: "Let's take this one piece at a time..."
4. Use analogies: Compare to familiar South African contexts

### Example Dialogue
> **Learner**: "I don't really understand what 'strategic alignment' means in practice."
>
> **Facilitator**: "Let me give you an example. Imagine a taxi association that wants to be known for reliable, safe transport. That's their strategy. If they buy the cheapest taxis without considering reliability, are they aligned with that strategy? What about if they never service the taxis to save money in the short term? Strategic alignment means making sure your asset decisions support what the organisation is trying to achieve. Can you think of an example from your own organisation?"

## When Learner Gives Surface-Level Answers

### Trigger Signs
- Very short responses
- Textbook definitions without understanding
- Agreement without elaboration

### Scaffolding Approach
1. Ask "why" and "how" follow-ups
2. Request specific examples
3. Introduce complexity: "What if..." scenarios
4. Challenge gently: "That's a good start. Let's go deeper..."

### Example Dialogue
> **Learner**: "Stakeholders are people who have an interest in the organisation."
>
> **Facilitator**: "That's correct at a basic level. But let's make it more meaningful. In your workplace, can you name three specific people or groups who would care if a critical piece of equipment failed? What would each of them care about - and might they care about different things?"

## When Learner Shows Signs of Frustration

### Trigger Signs
- Short, curt responses
- "I don't know" repeatedly
- Expressing confusion or overwhelm

### Scaffolding Approach
1. Acknowledge the difficulty: "This is a complex topic - it's okay to find it challenging"
2. Reduce pressure: "Let's pause and focus on just one aspect"
3. Celebrate progress: "You've already shown good understanding of X"
4. Offer a break: "Would it help to take a moment and come back to this?"
5. Simplify the question

### Example Dialogue
> **Learner**: "I really don't understand any of this. It's too complicated."
>
> **Facilitator**: "I hear you - organisational context involves a lot of moving parts. Let's simplify. Forget about stakeholders and governance for now. Just think about this: In your organisation, who decides what equipment to buy or replace? That's what we're really exploring - who makes decisions and why. Does that feel more approachable?"

## When Learner Has Misconceptions

### Trigger Signs
- Confident but incorrect statements
- Oversimplification of complex relationships
- Conflation of different concepts

### Scaffolding Approach
1. Don't directly contradict - explore through questions
2. Present counter-examples
3. Guide to the contradiction
4. Allow self-correction

### Example Dialogue
> **Learner**: "Asset management is basically just maintenance - keeping things working."
>
> **Facilitator**: "Maintenance is definitely an important part. But let me ask you this: if two pieces of equipment both need maintenance, but the budget only allows for one, how do you decide which one to fix? And who makes that decision? What factors do they consider? This is where asset management goes beyond just 'keeping things working.'"

## When Learner is Ahead of the Curve

### Trigger Signs
- Quick, accurate responses
- Requesting more complexity
- Making connections unprompted

### Scaffolding Approach
1. Increase complexity and nuance
2. Introduce edge cases and exceptions
3. Ask them to teach back the concept
4. Move to higher-order Bloom's levels (evaluate, create)

### Example Dialogue
> **Facilitator**: "You clearly have a strong grasp of stakeholder analysis. Let's push further. Imagine you've identified that the union and the finance team have completely opposing views on a major asset investment. The union wants reliability and safety; finance wants cost reduction. How would you navigate this? What frameworks or approaches might help?"

## Ubuntu Approach

Throughout all scaffolding:
- Emphasise that learning is a journey, not a destination
- Recognise the learner's existing knowledge and experience
- Build on strengths rather than focusing on gaps
- Create a safe space for uncertainty
- Celebrate questions as much as answers
- Use "we" language: "Let's explore this together"
