# Discovery Questions: GFMAM 311 - Organisational Context

These questions guide the AI facilitator in exploring the learner's understanding through Socratic dialogue.

## Opening Questions

### Connecting to Experience
- "In your workplace, who would you say is most affected when equipment fails unexpectedly?"
- "Can you think of a time when an asset decision was made that seemed to conflict with what your team needed?"
- "What do you think drives most decisions about equipment and assets in your organisation?"

### Establishing Context
- "If you had to explain what asset management is to a colleague who has never heard the term, what would you say?"
- "How do you think your organisation decides which assets are most important?"

## Strategic Alignment

### Exploring Understanding
- "What do you understand to be your organisation's main strategic objectives?"
- "How do you think asset management could help achieve those objectives?"
- "What might happen if asset management decisions were made without considering strategy?"

### Deepening Insight
- "Can you give an example of how a well-managed asset has contributed to organisational success?"
- "What trade-offs do you think leaders face when making asset decisions?"
- "How might short-term thinking affect long-term asset performance?"

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Identifying Stakeholders
- "Who in your organisation cares most about how assets perform?"
- "Are there people outside your organisation who have an interest in your assets?"
- "Who might have influence over asset decisions but not directly work with assets?"

### Understanding Interests
- "What do you think the finance team cares about when it comes to assets?"
- "How might safety concerns conflict with production demands?"
- "What does the community expect from organisations that operate significant assets?"

### Managing Relationships
- "If two stakeholders want opposite things, how should that be resolved?"
- "Who should have the final say in asset decisions?"
- "How can you gain support from stakeholders who resist change?"

## Governance Framework

### Understanding Structure
- "What role does policy play in asset management?"
- "Who should be accountable for asset management in an organisation?"
- "How do you ensure consistency in asset decisions across different teams?"

### Applying Standards
- "Have you heard of ISO 55001? What do you understand it to be about?"
- "Why might an organisation want to align with international standards?"
- "What documents or policies related to assets exist in your organisation?"

## Application and Synthesis

### Connecting Theory to Practice
- "Based on what we've discussed, what would you change about how your organisation manages assets?"
- "If you were advising a new asset management coordinator, what would you tell them to focus on first?"
- "How could you use stakeholder analysis to make a business case for asset management improvement?"

### Checking Understanding
- "Can you summarise the main elements of organisational context for asset management?"
- "What's the relationship between strategy, stakeholders, and governance?"
- "Why is understanding context important before implementing asset management practices?"

## Facilitator Notes

- Allow learners to draw from their own experience before introducing concepts
- Use "what if" questions to explore consequences of different approaches
- Encourage learners to identify contradictions or tensions in stakeholder interests
- Guide towards ISO 55001 alignment without making it the only answer
- Celebrate local South African examples and context where possible
